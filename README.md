# GPU-Accelerated-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow-and-CUDA
# Project Overview:
This project demonstrates how to accelerate deep learning image classification using CUDA-enabled GPUs with TensorFlow. It focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark in machine learning for evaluating models on small images.

By utilizing TensorFlow's GPU capabilities, training time is significantly reduced compared to CPU-based workflows. The project is structured to support data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance benchmarking, and real-time inference—making it a comprehensive end-to-end deep learning solution.
# Problem Statement:
Training deep learning models, especially CNNs, on large image datasets is computationally expensive and time-consuming on traditional CPU hardware. This project addresses this challenge by harnessing the power of GPUs via CUDA and TensorFlow to speed up model development, training, and deployment.
# Key Features:
a) CUDA Acceleration: Leverages NVIDIA’s CUDA toolkit to perform parallelized operations on the GPU, significantly speeding up training.

b) TensorFlow Integration: Uses TensorFlow's GPU support to build and train deep learning models efficiently.

c) Image Classification with CNN: Implements a robust CNN architecture trained on CIFAR-10, a dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

d) Modular Codebase: Includes clear modules for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and inference.

e) Real-Time Inference: Supports real-time prediction of new images using the trained model.

f) Performance Optimization: Includes tuning techniques like batch normalization, learning rate schedules, and data augmentation.
